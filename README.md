## Description

The project is a Word Counter application made in React.js. It allows the user to count the number of words in a given sentence. The app also provides a dark mode option for users who prefer a darker interface.

The app has a preview section that displays the typed words in real-time. This allows the user to see how many words they have typed and to correct any errors. The preview section also provides features such as converting the text to uppercase or lowercase, clearing the text, and copying the text.

Additionally, the app has a feature that displays the time frame for reading the entire sentence. This is calculated based on the average reading speed of a human. The time frame is displayed in seconds and can be used to help the user estimate how long it will take them to read the sentence.

The app is a simple and easy-to-use tool that can be used to count the number of words in a sentence. It also provides a number of features that can help the user with their writing, such as the preview section and the time frame feature.
